# AcmeTechtest

User portal for Acme Forklift Manager Application. You can import a list of forklifts, submit movement commands, and view obstacles.

## How To Start

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Ensure the dev server is running on 'http://localhost:4200/' or 'https://localhost:4200/' as that is only what the ForkliftManager will accept.
